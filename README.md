# Mandarin Stuff
- Just publicising some of the resources I use to learn mandarin
- Currently I am working on transferring my written notes to the vocab CSV files that will be interpreted by the Python script eventually
- This will allow for testing of translation, as well as presenting random English / Pinyin to be handwritten as characters on paper

## TODO:
- [ ] **Example functionality separate to definition**
- [ ] Copy over all written notes
- [ ] Practice En-Zh and Zh-En functionality
- [ ] Speed testing?
- [ ] Number generator - for practicing translating numbers Zh-En
- [ ] Simple sentence generator maybe? (perhaps scraping translation from Google Translate or similar (or using API if there is one))
